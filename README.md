# 🏫 Campus LAN Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 📖 Overview
This project simulates a **campus network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates **VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, trunking, DHCP services, DNS, NTP, SNMP, NAT, redundancy, ACLs, IPv4, IPv6, wireless, and more** in a hierarchical network design (Core–Distribution–Access).

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
The base topology for this project was originally created by **Jeremy’s IT Lab** as part of his CCNA Packet Tracer lab series.  
All configurations, documentation, and analysis in this repository were created independently by **Tyler Gibbs** for portfolio demonstration purposes.
